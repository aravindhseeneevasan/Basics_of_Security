**What is a network?**
>connecting two or more devices to share the information and services

**Protocols?**
>is the rules that governs how devices should be communicate with each other

**Network Reference Model?**
* >OSI-open system interconnection.
* >DOD -Department of Defense(TCP/IP)

**Network types?**
* >Lan -Under a single administration or the infrastructure for connecting the resources inside a building                
* >WAN -Two or more Lans connecting together to form a WAN or Two different adminstration               
* >MAN - Connecting different locations or geographic area               
* >SAN (Storage area network)- Provide high-speed , lossless connectivity to the data                
* >VPN - (Virtual Private Network) - used to send data securely in an unsecure or public network

**Network Artitechture**

**Host**
* >A device that is connected in the network can provide resources to the node of the network and also assigned with a valid address.                 
* >Client- Request data                       
* >Server- Send requeated data to client                                
    * >disadv-Single point of failure(can be avoided using redundancy in the server layer)               
* >Peer- Send and Request data                               
    *-Pose security problems since the data are spread across devices               
**Mainframe/terminal**                               
* thin client protocols are                                                               
 * RDP(remote desktop protocol) and  ICA(Independent Computer Architecture)
